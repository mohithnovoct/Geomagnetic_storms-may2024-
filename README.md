# Aurora Odyssey
Aurora Odyssey is a web application built using Dash that visualizes solar storms and auroras. It leverages FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, primarily used in astronomy, to display 2D heatmaps and 3D surface plots of solar data. This project focuses on the solar storms that occurred in May 2024, showcasing their impact on auroras across the globe.

Features:
Interactive visualization of solar data through 2D heatmaps and 3D surface plots.
Image carousel showcasing auroras observed during the May 2024 solar storms.
Dropdown selection for various FITS files to visualize different solar data.
Responsive design with Bootstrap for a better user experience.

Usage:
Upon launching the app, you'll see an introduction video followed by the solar storm information. You can select different FITS files from the dropdown to visualize the data in 2D heatmaps and 3D surface plots. The carousel displays stunning images of auroras observed during the solar storms.

Data Source:
The data used in this application is sourced from NASA, NOAA, Youtube and Chatgpt, focusing on solar activity and its effects on Earth.

Graph Explanation:
2D Heatmaps:
Description: A 2D heatmap provides a top-down view of the solar data, where each pixel's color intensity represents the radiation levels at that point on the Sun.
Understanding the Plot: Bright colors indicate high intensity (e.g., solar flares), while darker colors indicate quieter regions.

3D Surface Plots:
Description: The 3D surface plot adds depth to the data visualization, using height to represent intensity.
Understanding the Plot: High peaks represent areas of intense solar activity, while valleys indicate calmer regions. Users can rotate the plot for a better perspective of the data.
